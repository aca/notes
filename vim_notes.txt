READ results into cursor position (acme!) - http://stackoverflow.com/a/2960630 
                                            http://superuser.com/a/251959/114842
    :r!foo                  read in stdout from a shell command
    <c-r>=system('foo')
    :r [file]               read in contents of [file]
    <c-r>=&vim_variable     hint: works with tab-complete (wildmenu)
    <c-r>=SomeFunction()
    <c-r>[register_name]    % # : .

WRITE buffer to external process
    :w !bash                send buffer contents to bash
                            TODO: doesn't work with unsaved contents

FILTER buffer contents through shell command (acme!) - http://stackoverflow.com/a/790218/152142
    In normal mode, ! is an operator (action) like y/d/c. You can do: 
        !!
        {range}!!
        !{motion}{shell cmd} (e.g. !Gls<cr>)
    Instead of :.!date write "date" in a buffer, then (in normal mode): 
        !!bash<cr>

    :{range}! filters a range of lines through a command and replaces those 
    lines with the output.

    examples (normal mode):
        :%!             filters the whole buffer
        !{space}{cmd}   replace the current line with <cmd> stdout
        !{space}sh      run the current line as a shell command
        !Gsort          equivalent to :.,$!sort

REDIRECT messages (all output from all vim commands)
    :redir >> [file]
    :redir @x          redirect to register 'x'
    :redir END
    :let @x = system('ls')  store shell command output to register x

    example: write output from :changes to register 'x'
        :set nomore | redir @x | changes | redir END | set more
    then read into another buffer:
        <c-r>=@x

REGISTERS: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3997110/152142
    "=          expression register
                eg: "=command_or_&variable<cr>p
    ""          unnamed register (always gets written-to)
    ".          the last inserted text
    "_          blackhole register
    "0          contains the last yank
    "1-"9       contain the last 9 deletions
    y"x         yank line to register x
    yy"X        *append* line to register x

    example: replace word with last-yanked text
        ciw<C-r>0

    example (acme!): increment register x and insert its value
        let @x=@x+1 | exe 'norm i' . @x

fundamental:
    capitalizing (shift) performs the "inverse" of the command
    .             repeat the previous command
    :5,42[cmd]    prepend a range to any command
                  range can be defined by a search:
                    :/^start of test/+1,/^end of test/-1w! Xtest.c

modifiers:
    *,#  search "whole word" under cursor
    f    forward
    t    til

special buffers:
    q:
    q/

motion:
    + (aka <cr> or <c-m>) and - are actually useful (remap - to <c-cr>). To get
    similar behavior at the end of the line, use $ to move to the EOL, then j/k
    will "stick" to the end of the line.

search
    ';' is a special offset to "chain" searches. Example:
        ab/;/cd     search for "cd" after the next "ab"
    :%s/foo//gn     count matches of "foo"

vim regex features:
    \%# \%c \%l     cursor/column/line position
    \|              branch (OR)
    \&              branch concat: matches _only_ if the preceding branch(es) match at the _same_ position
                    example: "foo\&...bar" matches "foobar" but not "fooobar"
    \zs \ze
    .{-}            lazy (non-greedy) match. compare: .*
    \n              can be used anywhere in a pattern (for buffer contents
                    only; behaves different in string matcher)

substitute (search/replace):
  almost any character (following s) can be used as the delimiter:
    :%s/before/after/g
    :%s@before@after@g
  e-option:
    :%s/foo/bar/ge
                 ^--ignore errors

multi-repeat / global apply:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Power_of_g

    :[range]g/{pattern}/[cmd]    apply cmd to lines matching {pattern}
    :[range]g!/{pattern}/[cmd]   inversion (apply to lines NOT matching)

    examples:
        print all matches of /re/:   http://stackoverflow.com/a/509720/152142
            :g/re/p
        ...with line numbers:
            :g/re/#
        change (substitute) foo to bar only on #comment lines:
            :g/^\s*#/s/foo/bar/g
        reference the :g match in a substitute command:
            :g/.*\(foo\).*/s//\1/
        delete lines that match foo:
            :g/foo/d_
            :g/foo/normal dd
        append all lines matching foo to @a (use "qaq" to clear @a first!):
            qaq:g/foo/y A
            qaq:g/foo/normal "Ayy
        execute any command(s) for each line of a match:
            :g/foo/cmd | cmd | cmd
        append the result of col('.') to lines 265-292:
            265,292s/$/\=col('.')/
                        ^- \= is evaluated for each line

rubydo, pydo, perldo, luado, ...
    reverse lines 1-5
        :1,5luado return line:reverse()
    prepend each line with its length
        :pydo return str(len(line)) + line
    reverse WORDs on current line
        :.perldo $_ = join ' ', reverse split
    insert a random string of 8 characters (A-Z) at the end of every line
        :rubydo $_ += ' ' + (1..8).collect{('A'..'Z').to_a[rand 26]}.join

macros (complex-repeat):
    qx  start recording in register x 
    q   stop recording
    @x  execute the text in register x 
        example (acme!): yank any text, then execute with @"
    @@  replay the most recent macro
    @:  repeat the last command!

window management:
    ctrl-w-[v s o]
    ctrl-w-[c h j k l]
      dependent on cursor position! https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6051#issuecomment-277378836

WHAT I LEARNED FROM GITHUB
==========================
AFFIRMATIONS of common project management wisdom:
    - it is often better to let a request sit for a while (weeks, months)
      because users change their minds, or other developments in the project
      obviate the feature request.

NEW USER NOTES
==============
It's not really a matter of saving time, but eliminating friction (context-switches). Editing is a chore, and fiddling with text while taking notes, or debugging, or thinking about a problem, has a cost.
It's also quite alarming to reach a level of proficiency where you can make non-trivial edits without looking at what you're editing, and know that the edits are correct. Again, this avoids context-switches.
That's why Vim is so focused on precision ("do exactly this") rather than DWIM ("Do What I Mean [usually]": the emacs/IDE approach).
Certainly whether the ramp-up cost is worth the "payoff" is debatable, but for me, editing text became so irritating that my initial experiments with Vim were driven from pure exhaustion after years of blub-craft.

"what is a buffer? why make the distinction between a file and a buffer"?
    a buffer is the "Untitled-1.txt" that most text editors create when you
    start a new "file", but haven't saved that "file" yet. The thing that holds
    the text which hasn't been saved to disk yet, is called a "buffer". Most
    text editors don't call it anything, you just say "Untitled-1.txt" is an
    "unsaved file". Editors like emacs and Vim treat buffers as a first-class
    concept, and saving the buffer to disk is an optional thing you may choose
    to do with the buffer. But many buffers never exist as files: they're used
    for things like dialogs, UIs, message lists, etc. Being able to use the same
    editing and layout facilities for any of these text applications, compounds
    the utility of those facilities.

wildignore: set this to `tags` and pretty much nothing else. Otherwise many
    plugins will have bizarre bugs, because 'wildignore' affects the results of
    expand(), globpath(), glob(), and inline evaluations (:help `=).
autochdir: This setting should not exist. If you're using it, ask why. The
    concept of a "working directory" is useful, why trash it? _Numerous_ Vim
    operations (bufdo, windo, argdo, all kinds of plugins...) that work with
    buffers will change your WD as a side-effect of this option. If you want to
    work with a buffer's directory, just use this map instead:
        nnoremap cd :lcd %:p:h<bar>pwd<cr>
    Notice that changes the _local_ working directory.
transpose: Vim is "do exactly what I say" (cf. Emacs "transpose" which is DWIM.
    Why does Vim move the cursor when you yank or delete? It turns out this is
    a feature, and it can be used to transpose WORDs or words:
        foo(), bar/baz/ zub
    To transpose "bar/baz/" with "foo(),", move the cursor to the former and:
        daWBP "sadly, does not work at the end of a line
    In Vim we trade "smart" for "flexible and precise":
        https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-exchange

:preserve saves new files, even files without a name. Try :recover on a :new
file, you might be surprised.

:find foo<tab> (with path^=**) is a lot more useful than you think!

vim is a concept
    - modal editing, atomic edits, edit grammar
    - can be implemented in any editor/IDE
vim is a component
    - can be embedded in other applications/IDEs
vim is _not_ a platform (unlike emacs)
vim vs emacs:
    - worse is better?
        1 VimL is more accessible than elisp, for the 80% of programmers who are only comfortable with
          a conventional non-lisp language.
        2 vim is a DSL for editing text. it turns out that most users--most _power_ users--
          do not care about infinite extensibility. What matters for an editor is:
            - it fills the gap between shell scripts (or a 4GL for those who don't know scripting)
              and copy-paste. Macros + vim-regex + ex commands + text-objects + composable & repeatable
              operations fill that gap better than anything else so far.
              - one-liners like :g/r/e/<cmd> are a major component of that DSL.
                elisp (general-purpose language) isn't conducive to one-liners.
            - makes simple things easy and difficult things can be shelled out to external tools (unix way)
                - rewrite the universe in elisp is not a good tradeoff just to get extensibility,
                  because most users just want STDOUT & STDIN.
            - the DSL should be "optimized for usage, not programming" <= http://yosefk.com/blog/i-cant-believe-im-praising-tcl.html
                - "commands, not expressions"
                - "flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about"
                - "Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter much more"
                    - i.e., ex-commands!
        - I truly love the emacs model and elegance, and I had high hopes for Light Table.
            Now I believe the real progress will come from something like atom talking
            to an nvim server. nvim + extensible core (written in a popular language)
            + webkit engine. And of course, nvim for terminal setups.
                - evil-mode is superb, and I use it happily, but configuring it
                  _and_ configuring emacs besides will harm adoption. See [1] and [2] for why users won't move to emacs for evil-mode.
                  vim refugees who stick with emacs tend to give up on evil-mode: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2w8qk8/venturing_out_of_evil_mode/
    - convention over configuration (relatively...)
    - smaller surface area
    - backwards compatibility:
        - emacs plugins embrace the bleeding edge and commonly require latest emacs.
          - magit requires recent version of git: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3h81ct/magit_v220_released/cu5duih
        - vim reluctance to add features means plugins must find workarounds,
          which means they will be backwards-compatible.
      work only with 24.3 or even 24.4, which is the bleeding edge.
      Most Vim plugins support 7.2.
    - emacs is "not in the business of competing": http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2bho80/emacs_maintainer_were_not_in_the_business_of/cj5lr7d
    - vim is a "disposable" environment: spin one (or 20) up, do some work, shut it down.
        - drop session files anywhere to resume later.
        - fast startup is highly valued.
        - communicate with other instances (nvim msgpack, --remote)
        - similar to VMs, containers (docker), etc.
        - unlike emacs, which encourages a long-running instance.
    - The extreme malleability of emacs is not so important in practice: it is
      strongly discouraged for plugins or users to override arbitrary functions;
      instead, overrides should occur at "add-hook" or "after-load" events.
      http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html
        > Hooks are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs [...] to be
        > called on some well-defined occasion.
      Emacs extension points, then, are explicitly provided and known--to avoid
      chaos--as they would be in any flexible system. In the end,
      monkey-patching is a niche feature.
why vim?
    The big players are distracted by real problems, like compiler performance,
    debugging, and enterprise support. For this reason there will always be
    a niche for "long tail" projects like vim, which focus on a niche
    "problem": the space between ideation and implementation called "editing".
    Brooks would say that editing is not an essential complexity. The gains to be had
    from optimizing have an upper limit. (Have we reached it? I think with
    extensible text objects, we may be close. Then it will be a solved problem,
    and that's a good thing.) It turns out, though, that the "trivial
    inconveniences" of a workday add up quite a lot, and moreover are
    multiplied by the cost of a context-switch. When your regex skills are still
    weak after 10 years of developing, doing ad-hoc inspection of logs, errors,
    xml feeds, json responses, HTTP requests, (or looking for yet another
    special-purpose tool)... that slows you down and it interrupts your flow.
      So Vim and other niche editors have a job: (as a vocal contributor to
      Nvim, I consider it my job to make sure Nvim is _cognizant_ of this job,
      for perhaps the first time in editor history) piggyback on the big
      players, be a _passive_ beneficiary of their space-age plasma thrusters,
      like a courier (Y.T., Snowcrash) hitched to a semi, or a bug on an F16.
      Atom, Visual Studio, eclipse are big fish with a lot of energy; surf that
      energy instead of trying to reinvent it. Sun Tzu has a pithy parable for
      this. Rich Hickey would call this _leverage_. Get a lot for a little.
      Focus on the part that is actually unique to your tool. N/Vim can crank
      this up to 11 if we consciously acknowledge that this is the direction we
      want to go. Emacs community doesn't quite get
      this; although emacs is certainly interoperable with external tools, there
      is a culture of it, it's not the _default_ mode of operation, so you end
      up having to cobble together the conventions you expect from Vim
      (quickfix, makeprg, formatprg, ...). This means you don't benefit from
      network effects and others don't benefit from the little garden you have
      dug.

why was / chosen for the "search" operation?
    - / shares the same key as ? which is a reasonable mnemonic for "search".
        - but why should arbitrary key placement on the US layout determine the 
          mnemonics for a text manipulation DSL?
            - precisely because it is arbitrary, and in the end most keyboards
              can switch to US layout as needed. For the same reason that greek letters are 
              used as shorthand for a quantity-manipulation DSL--math--but the vastly
              most important function of this shorthand is to increase the density (throughput)
              and reduce friction of absorption (because remember, time complexity
              is lower-bounded by space complexity); and mnemonic is a minor incidental
              benefit that was most accessible to the originator and only helpful to the
              most curious of students today (eg, how many realize that sigma is a mnemonic
              for [S]um?). But for latin-based cultures, the mnemonics of the vim
              commands are there for the curious, as the mnemonics of greek are for 
              curious math students. The mnemonics are less intuitive for asian
              users, but the primary important result is that we have a dense
              language for text manipulation represented by economical symbols.
              From there we can move on to using the language, which is where
              the real value exists. Also from there, we can _extend_ the 
              language using the existing patterns. For example, / means search
              and g is the main "auxliary namespace" for vim commands, so g/
              can be used to prefix a namespace of advanced search functions.

sometimes I see a [noeol] warning when I open a file; and when I save the file
Vim adds a newline to the end of the file (shown by `git diff`).
    A: Text is a list of lines. Lines are separated by newline characters.
       Many text editors (esp. on Windows) don't follow this convention. But you
       can do a thought experiment to show that the convention makes sense: what
       is the result of concatenating two files? If they do not end in
       a newline, the last line of the first file will be concatenated to the
       first line of the 2nd file.
       Vim automatically adds a EOL to the end of such broken text files, but
       you can disable this in recent Vim versions with `set nofixeol`.

scoping (local variables): 
    let g:foo = 'qux'
    let foo = 'bar'
        - does _not_ overwrite g:foo
        - cannot overwrite v:foo
        - echo g:foo => 'qux'
        - echo foo => 'bar'
    l: is almost never needed, because:
        - 'let foo' will not modify the environment _outside_ of the local function scope

don't bother with cream
don't get windows build from vim.org

always use '' (not "") for regex strings

the primary value of vim is:
    - composition of commands
        - vim is command-oriented: searchable, malleable command history.
        - ex-command DSL for ad-hoc text mainpulation (no equiv. in emacs?)
    - repeatable
        text editing is an accidental task. in the future we might be editing ASTs, not text.
        see vim-sexp and evil+smartparen to see how the vim model applies beyond dumb text.
        (lambdu, MPS)
    - macros (record the literal keystrokes--also has a cost)
    - when you are able to efficiently navigate and manipulate arbitrary text:
        - special-purpose UIs are not necessary (or even, counterproductive)
        - reuse of the "buffer" concept allows new data/document types to be
          navigated with very little investment, yet a lot of leverage.
        - data may be annotated with "syntax" definitions and the same tools
          (motions, text objects, syntax objects, plugins) can operate as
          always; very powerful.
    - working with commands instead of blocks of (elisp) code:
        - command history is a primary tool: modifying command history as
          a buffer is key part of workflow.
        - cf. scratch buffer in emacs
        - visually scanning the command history, greater density

vim's "current directory" applies to the entire vim session (the current 
running instance of Vim), regardless of what file (buffer) you are 
currently using. Think of it as your "working directory" for the current 
vim session. 

lockvar: what does it do? is there a performance benefit? (no)

mbyte: "mbyte" in practice may be read as "UTF-8".

        - &encoding is usually set once and forever. It does not have anything
          to do with a buffer's read (e ++enc=..., &fileencodings), write
          (&fileencoding), or terminal encodings.
        - &encoding is the *internal representation* of a Vim string. All text
          Vim works with is *always* treated with this encoding. When a buffer
          is read it is converted to &encoding (&encoding is *not*
          buffer-local).
    emacs uses similar terms:  http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/13/
        There are three ways to quantify multibyte text:
            length: number of characters, including combining characters
            bytes:  number of bytes in its UTF-8 encoding
            width:  number of columns it would occupy in the current buffer

:make and &makeprg are for processing the current buffer through *any* program.
The name "make" is just a historical misnomer.

"quickfix" is a historical misnomer and it is perfectly acceptable to use
this buffer for any list of annotations received from :make.

Vim refers to text documents as *buffers*. Get used to that. This is a useful
distinction, not just pedantic, because: a new file, which is not saved 
yet, doesn't have a path on the filesystem yet: it may exist only in Vim. Vim 
also has special buffers like the "quick fix" window and the "preview" window.

Vim *in the terminal* is somewhat[1] at the mercy of the terminal. Using Vim in the 
terminal makes it obvious the distinctions that perhaps were not so 
important before you started using a text editor in the terminal. Before, 
the distinction between "shell" and "terminal emulator" may have seemed
like noise. But once you start using vim on different systems, the 
quirks of the various terminal and shell implementations are brought into
relief. A terminal sends characters to the shell. Vim, in the context of 
a terminal, accepts the characters sent to it. When you enter ALT-f in
terminal Vim, one terminal may send <foo>f to Vim, another <bar>f.
The state of the terminal in this decade might seem rather frustrating, 
but c'est la vie. Powershell is the only really innovative, 
widely-deployed alternative, and while it's to be commended, it doesn't 
have a terminal-resident editor (and it's terminal is cmd.exe). So if 
using terminal-vim as your *primary* editor is too much trouble, 
just use gvim and forget about it. But that's where we are. VT-100 legacy 
is sitting on top of a massive, massive pile of tools and powershell 
isn't positioned to address.

    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Mapping_fast_keycodes_in_terminal_Vim
        There are two types of keycodes: terminal keycodes and Vim keycodes. Terminal keycodes look something like
            ^[[1;2A
            These are actual bytes that are sent to Vim by the terminal when we type Shift-Up, for example (on an xterm).
        Vim keycodes look like
            <S-Up>
        Vim needs its own representation of keycodes because it runs on a variety of platforms.
        Vim can act upon its own keycodes, and leave the assignment of terminal keycodes to
        autodetection or to manual setup by the user.

    terminal on Windows: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/libuv/EhwAn3y9wWo/T-yyLvVmIrYJ
        "The ability to automate interactive programs using libuv would be a killer feature,
        libuv could be used as a replacement for libexpect and node.js a replacement for expect"

    NOTE(jkeyes): emacs calls these two concepts "function keys" and "control keys".

    'unconed' (author of TermKit) comment:
    https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/137kd9/c71iiec
        Unix magic like nested remote subshells and remote privilege escalation
        works only by accident, because the programs in between are too dumb to
        mess it up, not because of anything deliberate. Today, this means you
        still have to abort SSH sessions by typing magic sequences (return,
        tilde, period) rather than using out of band signalling, and catting
        binary files into your terminal can mess it up permanently.

    It's keymaps all the way down:
        terminal (possibly GUI) settings =>
        [tmux keymaps] =>
        terminfo/termcap =>
        stty/termios?/ioctl =>
        vim keymaps
            https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios-termios3-and-stty/
        https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim?at=55daecb204a6730031626642
          Q keymap is what? Does it map keys to something? And what is a key
            anyway, is it a sequence of bytes?

          Q What is terminfo and what does it do? Who is reading and who is
            writing it? How is it lying? How does a file lie in the first place?
            How are programs handling these lies?
          A terminfo is basically another keymap, just like vim's keymap or
            tmux's keymap.
            "terminfo" is a database (files on disk) keyed by the terminal name
            ($TERM) that explains what sequences of bytes you should send it to
            make it do things (like move the cursor or set it bold), or what
            sequences of bytes you should expect to see from it when users press
            keys.
            Most TI DBs report key_backspace incorrectly: they claim that the
            backspace key sends the 0x08 byte (ASCII BS, "Ctrl-H"), whereas
            their actual observed behavoiur is that actually they send 0x7f
            (ASCII DEL)
            Most programs basically ignore the key_backspace cap, and query
            termios instead.
                Example (Vim): https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/cde885473099296c4837de261833f48b24caf87c/src/os_unix.c#L3493-L3503
            More discussion: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3462#issuecomment-148711737
          Q What's the alternative?
          A Report terminfo bug to your distro. Fixing key_backspace won't
            hurt software that contains the workaround.
            Other alternative: terminal "feature detection. Example: 
                LeoNerd: libtickit infers that it can support 256 colour mode, by trying to set colour 255 and seeing if it succeeds
                LeoNerd: Becuse almost no terminal will respond to the question
                LeoNerd: Whereas prettymuch any terminal that can support 256 colours also supports the colour query
            There is a "query" feature for terminals, but few implement it.

sed becomes second nature as a side-effect of normal, prolific Vim usage.
Searching for ^\s.+ becomes an actually desirable thing to reach for, 
because then you can `cgn` the matches. Regex (even if quirky) becomes 
an actually desirable tool. Removing ambiguitiy from a text search 
(example: "find all lines that look like variable assignment and start with a dollar sign"),
instead of "don't bother", becomes a low-friction "yes, of course".
I had no desire to learn sed, because I always thought "I'll 
just reach for python or ruby or whatever". And yes, you can do that 
in vim too (:py :ruby :lua).

Why is <c-u> peppered all over mappings?
    Besides the obvious range that is inserted with : in visual-mode,
    a range is also inserted if you prepend : with a [count].
    This causes unwanted side effects (:h :func-range)
        Vim will call the function {range} times
        the cursor is moved to the start the line, even with a range of 1.
    A function marked with 'range' is sent magic parameters *a:firstline* *a:lastline*

wtf is noremap?
    non-recursive map

what is the difference between ttimeout and ttimeoutlen?
    " in the words of Steve Losh, "Basically this makes terminal Vim work sanely."
    "   https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/vimrc#cl-95
    ""
    " see also "terminal" section above
    set ttimeout
    set ttimeoutlen=100 "this is for keycodes
    set timeout
    set timeoutlen=3000 "this is for mappings

marks seems useless?
    - more useful if they appear in the signs column
    - don't conserve them. use them, abuse them!
        - put them on maps like ':nnoremap / ms/'

[count] seems useless
    - don't try to be exact. If you know a target is in the same column, say,
      about 10 lines away, just mash 8j.

leader key? => leader key is for throwaway mappings.
    - merging a bunch of files opened at the command line? ':nmap ,d ]agg]nd]ndd]n'
    - record a macro in @q and then store it in a map:
        nmap ,l <c-r><c-r>q

vnoremap, noremap, xnoremap. Q: Why care about selection-mode? A: For snippets plugins.

g@ is to create an operator (like 'd'), _not_ an operand (like 'w' or a custom
motion). To "create" an operand, simply omap to a function that check v:operator.

omnifunc is _not_ the same thing as completefunc: https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static/blob/8bed65c3f42aaf4d906aaca93d223f62a53542ce/ftplugin/clojure.vim#L34
    completefunc: User defined completion       :h compl-function
    omnifunc:     filetype-specific completion  :h compl-omni

ctrl-x mode offers _new_ ideas, _precision_ completion:
    "Let Vim do the typing" (George Brocklehurst)
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX3kV3TICU

    - Most people recommend ctrl-p because they want to search _up_ in the file
      (sort previous words first), rather than _down_ (sort later words first).

    - ctrl-x_ctrl-p (as opposed to just ctrl-p) offers _context-sensitive_
      completion. Note:
        - type nothing else except ctrl-x ctrl-p after each completion--while
          the menu is showing, do _not_ hit <esc> or <cr> or anything.
          ctrl-x_ctrl-p_ctrl-x_ctrl-p_...
        - 'completeopt' must not contain "longest"

'complete' option allows arbitrary files to be used for completion lists.

syntax plugin, ftplugin:
    http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2fdys2/question_custom_highlighting_in_vim/ck8dpxf

syntax highlighting is slow! long lines are slow! wtf?
    Any sufficiently flexible editor will run into issues with long lines if
    certain features are enabled.
    See this emacs-devel discussion:
        https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-12/msg00378.html

runtimepath is like bash $PATH. The order matters. Any VimL file in a plugin/
directory anywhere in your runtime path _is_ a plugin. You can force plugins
to run via ':runtime! foo.vim'

<Plug> mapping is just a "virtual key sequence" that can be mapped-to.
<Plug>(Foo) convention prevents timeoutlen pause caused by overlapping maps.

.gvimrc runs after .vimrc, and exists only to disable annoying gvim defaults.

inclusive vs exclusive (:help inclusive)
    Vim makes a distinction between _inclusive_ and _exclusive_ motion.
    v toggles the "inclusiveness" or "exclusiveness" of a motion.
    Examples:
        dvb     inclusive `b`
        dve     exclusive `e`

how do I "zoom" a window temporarily without messing up the existing window layout?
    :tab split

:find only opens the first file matching a glob expression. How can I open
_all_ files matching a glob?
    :n {glob}   "synonym for `:args {glob}`

you don't need https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user
    - see jdaddy.vim (#inner_movement) for an elegacy text-object pattern.
    - and of course, g@/opfunc already exist to define operators

what if i SSH into a machine? will it still show unicode chars correctly?
    Display of characters is up to the _final_ device. Incidentally, this is
    still reflected in the name "terminal": it's the end-user device. Even if
    you're tunneled to a unix machine without X, as long as the remote process
    sends back the correct terminal sequences, your terminal can display them.
    (Note that Vim cares a lot about what $TERM you declare, whereas Nvim tends
    to assume you're running a modern terminal of some sort.)

when is ' mark useful instead of ` mark?
    When you want linewise motion instead of characterwise.
    Example:
            1: 111[cursor]222
            2: 333[mark `]444
        To delete the *entire* lines 1-2: d''

What is the purpose of "magic"? The choices of special and non-special
characters seems very unintuitive.

  - The default ("magic") mode should be thought of as: only a few
    *commonly-used* special chars are considered special. This is for
    quick-and-dirty work. `$^[].*` are very commonly needed when searching, so
    they are considered special by default "magic".
      - You might be surprised `+()` are not special, but... you'll get used to
        it. The idea is that you *usually* want `/` to do a *literal* search
        (except for the workhorse `$^[].*` functions).
  - Any time you're doing real work, use `\v` ("very magic"). Everything that
    can be special, is special.

  *When in doubt*, just plop a `\v` at the front of your expression. (I don't
  recommend _defaulting_ to `\v`: opt-in is easier than opt-out).

      :g/\vfoo+/d

  Eventually you'll get tired of doing this and realize that if you only need
  a few special characters like `.*` or `$`, then the default "magic" is
  actually really convenient.

Default 'path': opt-in is easier than opt-out

list sources https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/660
    Helm is like unite.vim. The idea of a unified interface for searching lists is
    really one of the next pillars of fundamental UIs (like copy & paste, files &
    directories, and URLs). Emacs and Vim provide something really unique here
    that isn't found in many other places:
        - ability to search lists using a bag of algorithms
        - ability to *sanely* define new sources (like [this](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim/blob/master/autoload/unite/sources/tmuxcomplete.vim))
        - ability to extend and define new actions on list items
    Lists are everywhere; intelligent, effortless search should be available for every
    kind of list source you feel like you need. 

    http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2coqzs/how_do_you_work_with_vim/cji6wuu
        Helm is a completion and narrowing framework. It provides an interface that
        allow multi-step and out-of-order searching. For example, if I
        want to search for list-package, "lis pac" or "pa ^li" will match.
