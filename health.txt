Sleep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig

Less than 7 hours:
- measurable objective impairments
- 30% less endurance (quicker physical exhaustion, lactic acid)
- testosterone levels comparable to 10 years older
- strong predictor of cancer

Visualizing an activity is 50% as effective as performing it.

Treatment:
  Go to bed same time every day.
  Turn off most house lights at night.
  Lowering temperature = sleep-trigger
  Raising temperature = wake-trigger

1 hour of screen time before bed delays melatonin by 3 hours .
Wakefulness is low-grade brain damage, sleep repairs it.
Sleep-deprived are not equipped to judge their own impairment.
Sleep deprivation has same symptoms as ADHD.
Without sufficient sleep: 70% of weight loss consumes lean body mass (muscle, not fat).

NMN promotes NAD.
NAD helps blood vessel lining to "respond to exercise"
NAD decreases lactic acid, muscle fatigue.
> 1.0 g NMN each morning with yogurt.
> 0.5 g of resveratrol each morning.
> 1.0 g metformin each night. Protects against alzheimers.

You need a period every day, where youâ€™re hungry.

Wim Hof method
breathing
  - Full & Deep Inhale: belly chest head, in that order
  - Exhale (just let go of the held breath, don't push out).
  - Repeat 30 times. You may get light-headed & feel tingling. This is normal.
  - Exhale & hold the exhalation out for as long as is comfortable.
  - When you cannot hold the exhalation anymore, take a long, deep breath through
    the nose into the stomach & hold the breath for 15 seconds.
  - Exhale.
  - This marks a complete round.
  - Repeat for 3-5 rounds every morning.
  - Best performed on an empty stomach.
cold shower: 2-min at start of each day
  - wakes up vascular system => heart does less work
  - lowers heart-rate => lower stress, healthier heart

ankle sprain

If you protect your injured ankle ligaments appropriately the torn ligaments
will successfully reattach and heal a normal functional length. Mature scar
formation takes at least six weeks. During this time period, you should aim to
optimally remould your scar tissue to allow for full functional ankle movement
and prevent a poorly formed scar that will re-tear in the future.

phase 1
  RICE protocol:
  - Rest your ankle by not walking on it.
  - Ice to keep the swelling down. 20 to 30 minutes, 3-4 times daily.
  - Compression dressings/bandages to immobilize and support your injured ankle.
  - Elevate your ankle above the level of your heart as often as possible during the first 48 hours.

phase 2:
  Physical therapy / Rehabilitation exercises
   https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/sprained-ankle/
  - Proprioception (balance) training.
    balance exercise: standing on the affected foot with the opposite foot
    raised and eyes closed.
  - Endurance and agility exercises: Running in progressively smaller
    figure-eights is excellent for agility and calf and ankle strength.
  - strengthen calf, ankle and foot muscles


Prevention
  The best way to prevent ankle sprains is to maintain good muscle strength,
  balance, and flexibility.
  - Warm up thoroughly before physical activity
  - Wear shoes that are made for your activity

Post
  Incomplete rehabilitation is the most common cause of chronic ankle
  instability after a sprain. If a patient stops doing the strengthening
  exercises, the injured ligament(s) will weaken and put the patient at risk for
  continued ankle sprains.

  It can be hard for patients to tell if a sprain has healed because even an
  ankle with a chronic tear can be highly functional.

avoid: PFAS chemicals in water, clothing
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696

- PFAS = perfluoroalkyl substances
- byproduct of Teflon, Scotchguard, firefighting foam production process
- bio-accumulates (body does not quickly flush/degrade this substance)
toxicological implications: Â https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22119403
> doesn't degrade and accumulates in the body
> half-life of 3.8 years in human blood

> Of tap water samples taken by EWG from 44 sites in 31 states and Washington D.C., only one location, Meridian, Mississippi, which relies on 700 foot (215 m) deep wells, had no detectable PFAS.
> Only Seattle and Tuscaloosa, Alabama had levels below 1 part per trillion (PPT),

> EPA has known since at least 2001 about the problem of PFAS in drinking water

> PFAS chemicals are sprayed liberally onto the surface of clothing, and furniture, and this may account for far more human PFAS consumption than drinking water.
