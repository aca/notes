parts:
  x power connector adapter: XT60 male to Deans(T) female
  x lipo battery alarm: attach to battery to avoid completely discharging the battery (dangerous)

  x soldering iron
  x raspi
    multimeter
    (optional) IMU setup: BNO080 IMU + Teensy LC
    feet: for slippery surface, get rubber grommets (McMaster #90131A101) and fasten them to the pre-drilled holes in the feet.
          "Any sort of rubber disc/washer should work. Attach with short M3x8 screws and locknuts."

LIPO BATTERY:
  Always charge in BALANCE mode.
  DISCHARGING TOO MUCH = risk of fire.
    Below 3V per-cell => permanent degradation.
    Set "low-voltage cutoff" to 3.4V per cell.
  Safest charge-rate for LiPo batteries is 1C, or 1x capacity of battery in Amps.
    => for 5200mAh battery use 5.2A
    if charger doesn't support 5.2A it's fine to use a lower value, just takes longer
  STORAGE:
    Always set LiPo to "storage charge" if you won't use it same-day.
    Proper LiPo storage voltage = 3.8V per cell
    LiPo battery can be damaged by sitting fully charged for as little as 1 week.

software
  use of `dd` to flash the sd card: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md
    $ sudo dd bs=1m if=2019-09-26-raspbian-buster-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2 ; sync
  "using latest raspbian OS: The only thing that needed to be corrected were missing udev rules for the PS4 controller. Otherwise the software instructions were sufficient." https://groups.google.com/d/msg/stanford-quadrupeds/e01e9xvb4V4/2o81D3CeBwAJ

behavior
  Q1: Robot walks too fast. How can I control the speed of the robot?
  A1: You can adjust the frequency of the trot in the config file here:
      https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped/blob/master/pupper/Config.py.
      Look for two variables: self.overlap_time and self.swing_time
