U.S. defense lawyers to seek access to DEA hidden intelligence evidence | Reuters
================================================================================
  Internal training documents reported by Reuters this week instruct agents not to reveal information they get from a unit of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, but instead to recreate the same information by other means. A similar set of instructions was included in an IRS manual in 2005 and 2006, Reuters reported. / The DEA unit, known as the Special Operations Division, or SOD, receives intelligence from intercepts, wiretaps, informants and phone records, and funnels tips to other law enforcement agencies, the documents said. Some but not all of the information is classified.

> At Jetpac my colleagues and I built mustache detectors to recognize bars full of hipsters, blue sky detectors to find pubs with beer gardens, and dog detectors to spot canine-friendly cafes. At first, we used the traditional computer vision approaches that I'd used my whole career, writing a big ball of custom logic to laboriously recognize one object at a time. For example, to spot sky I'd first run a color detection filter over the whole image looking for shades of blue, and then look at the upper third. If it was mostly blue, and the lower portion of the image wasn't, then I'd classify that as probably a photo of the outdoors.
> I'd been an engineer working on vision problems since the late 90's, and the sad truth was that unless you had a research team and plenty of time behind you, this sort of hand-tailored hack was the only way to get usable results. As you can imagine, the results were far from perfect and each detector I wrote was a custom job, and didn't help me with the next thing I needed to recognize. This probably seems laughable to anybody who didn't work in computer vision in the recent past! It's such a primitive way of solving the problem, it sounds like it should have been superseded long ago.
> That's why I was so excited when I started to play around with deep learning. It became clear as I tried them out that the latest approaches using convolutional neural networks were producing far better results than my hand-tuned code on similar problems. Not only that, the process of training a detector for a new class of object was much easier. I didn't have to think about what features to detect, I'd just supply a network with new training examples and it would take it from there.

> It is purely an accounting identity that if other countries become net exporters of capital to the US, they must run current account surpluses (although not necessarily bilateral surpluses, which are in fact unlikely) and the US must run current account deficits (although not necessarily bilateral deficits, of course), and it is also purely an accounting identity that if the US runs a current account deficit, its domestic savings must be lower than its domestic investment.
>  ...
> I remember reading in the early 1990s for example a very interesting book about the US “long depression” of the 1880s and 1890s that began with the September 1873 crash in the NY Stock Exchange. The book explored the roots of the crisis in the railroad boom of the 1860s and wonderfully invoked the famous attempt by Jay Gould and James Fisk to corner the gold market in 1869. There was however almost no reference to events outside the US except in describing how the New York crisis subsequently affected British banks. It seemed that for the authors, events in the US pretty much explained everything that happened in the US economy before and after the 1873 crisis.

> It wasn’t until a few years later when I read Charles Kindleberger’s brilliant book, A Financial History of Western Europe, that I realized that the 1873 crisis was a global crisis, and that it didn’t even originate in the US. It actually began in May, 1873, with the collapse of the Vienna stock market, which spread to Berlin and London before it hit New York. I also learned that the roots of financial instability included the 1866 collapse of Overend, Gurny, a major London bank, and that stock markets around the world had soared shortly after Barings had financed the huge French war indemnity forced upon France after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. One of Kindleberger’s great insights was that the recycling of massive payments, such as the French indemnity, often leads to liquidity-driven speculative frenzies in stock, bond and real estate markets.
>  ...
> In the 1810s Latin Americans began their wars of independence against Spain, one consequence of which was a collapse in silver production and a surge in European silver prices. When this happened England could no longer afford to exchange tea for silver, so they switched to opium, which they obtained from India at least partly in exchange for textiles, having pretty much demolished the more efficient Indian textile industry in the 18th Century. This loss of silver imports put enormous pressure on the Qing treasury and led ultimately to the sequence about which we are so familiar.
>  ...
> Brazil and Australia had booming economies during this century, for example, but how many people know the role of artificially low Chinese interest rates in creating the boom? It is not a coincidence that the boom in both countries has ended just as the amount of interest rate repression in China has almost disappeared.
> ...
> China’s extraordinarily high savings rate is almost wholly explained by the transfer mechanisms that subsidized rapid growth over the past two decades, leaving Chinese households with the lowest share of GDP in the world, and perhaps the lowest ever recorded for a large economy. Arithmetic, not to mention historical precedents, can easily explain why these transfers, which during this century amounted to as much as 5-8 percent of GDP annually, would drive down the household consumption share of GDP by driving down the household income share, and of course high savings are simply the obverse of low consumption.
> ...Policies that affect the savings rate of a small country can have more-or-less predictable domestic impacts because the closed system within which it operates, the global economy, is so large that domestic policies are not affected by external constraints. But when you are thinking about a large economy, you have to change your analysis. In a globalized world anything that changes the domestic relationship between savings and investment must automatically change the relationship between savings and investment abroad in the obverse way [...] If the savings rate of Spain (the open system) declined after 2003, as it did, the reason may have as much to do with Spain as it has to do with someone else within Europe (the relevant closed system within which it operated) – Germany, in this case – and so trying to resolve it by “undoing” the Spanish “cause” may be useless, or even reckless [...]

> [...]

> 3.) Do you think there is a global currency war going on?

> Of course there is. Historically whenever global demand is weak, and unemployment high, countries will try to gain a larger share of that demand by reducing wages or otherwise taxing households to subsidize production (devaluing the currency is just a way to tax the consumption of imports and to subsidize exporters). Unfortunately these policies reduce demand further by reducing real household income and, with it, the amount households can spend. This is why in the 1930s these policies were referred to as beggar-thy-neighbor policies. In effect they forced countries with high unemployment to respond to weak global demand with policies that reduced their own contribution to global demand while grabbing a larger share of the smaller total.

> But we must remember that they are not doing this to be pests. In most cases they have little choice. In a world with few constraints on trade or capital flows, if you try to raise domestic consumption by raising household income – for example by raising wages – your contribution to global demand will indeed rise, but your export competitiveness will decline, and so you may retain a smaller share of that greater amount.  In a globalized world, without a globally coordinated no-cheating boost in spending, beggar-they-neighbor policies may be systemically crazy but they are individually rational.

> And they are always rationalized in exactly the same way. Countries try to force down wages, devalue their currencies, and otherwise increase the short-term, competiveness of their economies only in order to protect themselves from the depredations of others. Spain wants to force down workers’ wages today because German wage growth was cut by more than one-half in the decade after the turn of the century, even though the German economy was growing faster than it had in the decade before, and the creation of the euro was supposed to make everyone richer. If Spain succeeds, global demand will drop but Spain’s share will rise.

> [...]
> This is why the political, legal, social and financial institutions that constrain the adjustment process for each country are so important. Not all growth miracles, for example, are followed by successful adjustments and more long-term growth. In fact they rarely are. In the 1960s it was widely “known” that the USSR, then completing nearly two decades of phenomenal growth, whose exploits included the first manned satellite and the first space walk, would almost certainly overtake the US both technologically and economically by the end of the century.

> Today those expectations seem almost comical. The country had wracked up so much debt during the late stages of its growth miracle, and for all its spectacular growth was unable to deliver more than a minimum amount of consumer products to it citizenry (it is considered shocking to say this in polite company, but consumption-driven economies seem to be far more innovative and productive that investment–driven economies, perhaps because of the decentralization of demand).

> [...]
> ...rapid growth is always unbalanced growth, and many years of rapid growth are nearly always derailed by debt.

  An odd malloc() size will always result in an off-by-one off the end being harmless, due to malloc() minimum alignment being sizeof(void*). / Memory leaks in setuid binaries are surprisingly dangerous because they can provide a heap spray primitive. / / http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1998/Oct/109 / With the stack having shifted down 0xec bytes, it picks up the return address from the local buffer containing the exploit code.

Thousand-robot swarm self-assembles into arbitrary shapes | Robohub
================================================================================
  decentralised, scalable, self-organizing autonomous robots. / No GPS-like system was available for them to know their location in the environment. Instead, robots had to form a virtual coordinate system using communication with, and measured distances to, neighbours. / Four specially programmed seed robots are then added to the edge of the group, marking the position and orientation of the shape. These seed robots emit a message that propagates to each robot in the blob and allows them to know how ‚Äúfar‚Äù away from the seed they are and their relative coordinates. Robots on the edge of the blob then follow the edge until they reach the desired location in the shape that is growing in successive layers from the seed. / [paper: justin.werfel@wyss.harvard.edu http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/754 ] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8178978

Twenty Questions for Donald Knuth
================================================================================
  The supposedly &quot;most efficient&quot; algorithms [...] are too complicated to be trustworthy, even if I had a year to implement one of them. / The present state of research in algorithm design misunderstands the true nature of efficiency. / Although I was expecting your method to be the winner, because it examines much of the data only half as often as the others, it actually came out two to three times worse than Kruskal's venerable method. Part of the reason was poor cache interaction, but the main cause was a large constant factor hidden by O notation.

Hello World: USENIX Winter 1993 paper by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson on UTF-8 under Plan 9
================================================================================
  Unicode defines an adequate character set but an unreasonable representation. / UTF-1 advantages: It is a byte encoding and is therefore byte-order independent. ASCII control characters appear in the byte stream only as themselves, never as an element of a sequence encoding another character, so newline bytes separate lines of UTF text. / UTF-1 major disadvantage: not self-synchronizing =&gt; cannot find the character boundaries in a UTF string without reading from the beginning. / &quot;The actual encoding is relatively unimportant to the software; the adoption of large characters and a byte-stream encoding per se are much deeper issues.&quot;

What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs to Know About Encodings and Character Sets to Work With Text
================================================================================
  Unicode is not an encoding. Unicode defines a table of code points for characters. The character ·∏Ä has the Unicode code point U+1E00. UTF-32 is an encoding that encodes all Unicode code points using 32 bits: 4 bytes per character. UTF-16 and UTF-8 are variable-length encodings. &quot;Unicode support&quot; in a programming language or OS is not necessary as long as the runtime treats a string input as a bit stream and does not attempt to manipulate it as a specific encoding. You only need to be careful when _manipulating_ strings (slicing, trimming, counting), i.e. operations that happen on a _character_ level rather than a _byte_ level.

How SQL Server Generates the Query Plan
================================================================================
  SQL Server not any perform flow analysis, so local variables in a sproc can kill the query plan. / SET ARITHABORT ON doesn't really fix performance issues, it just appears to temporarily because it is a cache key, and setting it changes the query so that a new query plan is generated. So the next execution will appear fast because it is optimized, but then later executions (using _different_ parameters) will be slow again, because they are using the query plan that was cached for the previous parameter values. The _real_ problem is related to parameter sniffing.

Out of Prohibition‚Äôs Reach: How Technology Cures Toxic Policy
================================================================================
  The shutdown also motivated improvements as new marketplaces started offering features like faster services, private messaging that requires encryption, and bitcoin escrow services that eliminate the possibility of the marketplace scamming users. / In terms of scam prevention, most marketplaces actively work to make scamming unattractive. Anyone that wants to sell as a vendor is required to post a bond until they reach a certain amount of sales and positive reviews. / Decentralized marketplaces like the experimental ‚ÄúDarkMarket‚Äù platform, recently renamed ‚ÄúOpenBazaar‚Äù, are the next step towards the cure. DarkMarket is peer-to-peer which means that every user serves up their own buyer or seller page, as opposed to that page being served up by a server like on traditional websites or current anonymous marketplaces.

cancer
================================================================================
  Cancer is a disease that combines the trickiest parts of aging with the trickiest parts of infectious disease. Cell replication ... several trillions of times per day ... essentially copying 1 billion TB of data while detecting and fixing every error. Everybody will get cancer ... then you have a cell that your immune system has carefully trained for decades not to engage, invading and hogging every resource it can, with mutations that allow it to adapt to selective pressures, including drugs. Essentially, it's an infectious parasite, except it looks 99% like your own cells to your immune system, and is already perfectly suited to your metabolism. / From an evolutionary standpoint, no species would ever naturally develop perfect DNA replication because it would halt diversification. / [Imagine a billion nanobots...] You've basically described the immune system! Trillions of cells, thousands of genes controlling each one, hypermutations creating billions of different antibodies.

Most had been sold to Iraq, where an Interior Ministry investigation would eventually show that corruption on a titanic scale had made the ATSC contracts possible. In a 2011 Report to Congress, the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction estimated that 75 percent of the value of McCormick‚Äôs sales had been spent on bribes.

RockStarProgrammer - The Differences Between Mercurial and Git
================================================================================
  git is more granular than mercurial =&gt; very beneficial in creating new types of workflows mercurial: heads/branches are inferred by lack of children git: branches are &quot;namespaced&quot; per remote. All heads are explicit. A tag or a branch points to a particular node in the graph, and there are tools to compare the changes between two nodes; allows private branches. mercurial: history is immutable / changing history is discouraged git: mutability is normal part of workflow mercurial, the branch name is stored in the changeset. Easy to have duplicate/conflicting branch names. the branch name is in the changeset, so the branch lives forever =&gt; discourages throw-away branches / experimentation. In git, a branch is just a head. Changing a branch actually moves the pointer to the new changeset (hash/commit). This head must be _explicitly_ shared across repositories. - won't accidentally push code you don't mean to. - no fear of name collisions. / hg cannot shallow clone.

White House Worked With Buyout Firm to Save Plant - WSJ.com
================================================================================
  White House played a central role in encouraging another private-equity firm to rescue a Philadelphia oil refinery, whose imminent closure by owner Sunoco Inc. threatened to send gasoline prices higher before the election. Gene Sperling, director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council, helped kick-start discussions to sell the refinery to Carlyle Group, CG -0.04% a well-connected Washington, D.C., private-equity firm. [...] regulators agreed to loosen certain environmental restrictions on the refinery. Pennsylvania's Republican governor, Tom Corbett, contributed $25 million in state subsidies and other incentives. [...] The White House referred the issue to the EPA, which along with state and local environmental officials agreed to modify the decree, allowing Carlyle to transfer emissions credits from the Marcus Hook refinery, in effect giving the Philadelphia refinery greater leeway to pollute.

The If Works - Translation from Haskell to JavaScript of selected portions of the best introduction to monads I‚Äôve ever read
================================================================================
  monad: a design pattern. It says that whenever you have a class of functions that accept one type and return another type, there are two functions that can be applied across this class to make them composable: - 'bind' function: transforms any function to accept the same type as it returns, making it composable - 'unit' function: wraps a value in the type accepted by the composable functions. 'monad' pattern helps you spot accidental complexity: code that isn‚Äôt dealing directly with the problem at hand, but which is just glueing data types together.

  Partial Failure ...

Benefits: Perfect control, reproducibility, tracibility. Costs: You‚Äôre forced to reify all your actions. You have to model every change that needs your attention into a message.

High Scalability - 7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30¬†Minutes
================================================================================
  Jitter - Add Entropy Back into Your System: If your system doesn‚Äôt jitter then you get thundering herds. Debugging distributed applications is as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness because things tend to stack up. For example, cache expirations: If everything expires at one time this creates a thundering herd. To introduce &quot;jitter&quot; you might randomly expire between 18-30 hours. Each machine actually removes entropy from the system, so you have to add some back in. Cheating - Know How to Fake Data: The fastest function call is the one that doesn‚Äôt happen. A monotonically increasing counter, like movie view counts or profile view counts, could update by a random amount and as long as it changes from odd to even people would probably believe it‚Äôs real, and the actual transactions only need to happen occasionally.

For the lead role, he had one stipulation: It had to be played by an actual genius, regardless of the discipline. ... &quot;All geniuses are foreigners,&quot; Khrzhanovsky tells me cryptically. ... Sveta, the film's comely &quot;executive producer,&quot; came here two years ago to interview Khrzhanovsky for a book on young Russian directors and stayed, divorcing her husband soon after.

The (Illegal) Private Bus System That Works - Lisa Margonelli - National - The Atlantic
================================================================================
  The city's perverse policy of half-legalizing legal vans and failing to enforce laws against the unlicensed ones limits the growth of what could be a useful transit resource. --- Comment: The chief reason for the demise of privately owned mass transit and the decline of the succeeding publicly owned version was the inability of transit providers to raise fares. No politician wanted to preside over a fare increase, so fares were kept artificially and unrealistically low for decades until the 70s, when there was finally a crisis. Should the dollar vans be fully legalized, and therefore regulated, we can expect politicians -- who are universally devoid both of economic knowledge and of business sense -- to replay the former history, so that Winston and his fellows will be bankrupt within 10 years of achieving legality.

================================================================================
  Version numbers have three components: major.minor.bugfix. For example: 1.2.4 or 2.13.0.Versions with a major version of 0 (e.g. 0.2.3) make no guarantees about backwards compatibility. You are free to break anything you want. It‚Äôs only after you release 1.0.0 that you begin making promises.If a release introduces backwards-incompatible changes, increment the major version number.If a release is backwards-compatible, but adds new features, increment the minor version number.If a release simply fixes bugs, refactors code, or improves performance, increment the bugfix version number.

Why do electron orbitals in the molecular orbital theory form in those specific shapes?
================================================================================
  Suppose I connect the ends of the string. All of a sudden, only certain vibrations make any sense on that string, because other wavelengths won't match up at the point where the string is connected together. We refer to this as a periodic boundary condition, that the value of the wave at x must be equal to the value of the wave at x+2pi. Now imagine the same thing all the way around the surface of a sphere. Start at any point, travel in any direction for one trip around the sphere, and the function has to return to the same value for the description to be logical. Then you can take another step and talk about the family of solutions on the surface of a sphere; in one case, the trivial one, there are no nodes, the whole sphere kind of &quot;breathes&quot; together. Then we introduce one equatorial node, the north pole vibrates out and the south pole vibrates in, and then the reverse. Then we add more and more nodes of vibration.

How to write FSM in Verilog?
================================================================================
  Compare/contrast 3 approaches to implementing a FSM. 1. uses a function for the combinational part. next_state is a WIRE, concurrent assignment (not sequential).¬† 2. Two 'always' blocks: the comb. block is level-sensitive to certain signals, whereas the seq. block is edge-sensitive to the clock. next_state is a REG. 3. One 'always' block, edge-sensitive to clock only. No next_state variable. Signals checked before assigning state. Notice the sequential part 'always @ (posedge clock)' waits 1ns before assigning values (e.g., 'state &lt;= ¬†#1 ¬†next_state').¬†

  Human-readable paragraphs based on your keywords. Link a couple of times naturally to his site.Change description (automatically) every X number of page loads or Y number of weeks, whichever comes first.Do *not* have him do the same thing for you. Do this for him for ~6 months, then take it off of your site for a while and then have him do the same for you. You do *not* want to simply cross link.Content and context is important. You want the SE's to associate the link with the text around it.Doing this with a few friends (or a network of your own sites) can be effective if you don't tip the scale to spam. Keep it interesting for humans - measure the human CTR on the links, remove-low preforming paragraphs and add new ones in their place to refine the process. This is not only valuable for your community but this keeps the white hat on and Google happy. You also want a good human CTR, e.g. 1000 clicks for every auto-change.

Much of creativity is learning how to see things properly...&quot; &quot;time management... logarithmic time planning, in which events that are close at hand are scheduled with finer resolution than events that are far off.&quot;

================================================================================
  &quot;There were very specific criteria that needed to be met by the person. Mainly an ISP that would play ball, this was a habitual seeder, meaning we were able to obtain a small % of at least 500-1000 different titles from that very person, and they had to be sharing a certain number of specifc titles.&quot; &quot;For the longest time people couldn't figure out why the download would stop at 98% and never finish, but it was because they had just spent the time downloading a fake file. That never happens on NNTP. ... We can't see who is downloading a file from some NNTP server, the only thing we could ever do was issue DMCA notices to the server admins to remove files when we found them, but those files would only be gone for a few minutes before someone would put them right back on.&quot;

Are Machine-Learned Models Prone to Catastrophic Errors?
================================================================================
  Nassim Taleb divides phenomena into two classes: Mediocristan, consisting of phenomena that fit the bell curve model, such as games of chance, height and weight in humans, and so on. Here future observations can be predicted by extrapolating from variations in statistics based on past observation (for example, sample means and standard deviations). Extremistan, consisting of phenomena that don't fit the bell curve model, such as the search queries, the stock market, the length of wars, and so on. Sometimes such phenomena can sometimes be modeled using power laws or fractal distributions, and sometimes not. In many cases, the very notion of a standard deviation is meaningless. The current generation of machine learning algorithms can work well in Mediocristan but not in Extremistan. The very metrics these algorithms use, such as precision, recall, and root-mean square error (RMSE), make sense only in Mediocristan.

================================================================================
  It‚Äôs difficult for most people to get optimal amounts of vitamin D. The diet, at best, will only provide a few hundred units of vitamin D. Milk is fortified with synthetic vitamin D2, which is not nearly as potent as natural D3, which is used in most dietary supplements. A glass of milk provides only 100 IU (2.5 micrograms). Fifteen minutes of sun exposure to 40-percent of the body is suggested daily for fair-skinned individuals. mortality rates for melanoma rose steeply after sunscreens came into common use, not before. Sunscreen lotion blocks the vitamin D-producing UV-B rays, while allowing the deeper-penetrating, cancer-causing UV-A rays to burn the skin. Many health food stores stock 1000 IU vitamin D pills. Most multivitamins provide no more than 400 IU .

Cato Unbound &quot; Blog Archive &quot; Beyond Folk Activism
================================================================================
  &quot;When we read in the evening paper that we‚Äôre footing the bill for another bailout, we react by complaining to our friends, suggesting alternatives, and trying to build coalitions for reform. This primal behavior is as good a guide for how to effectively reform modern political systems as our instinctive taste for sugar and fat is for how to eat nutritiously.&quot; ... &quot;Folk activism treats policies and institutions as the result of specific human intent. But policies are in large part an emergent behavior of institutions, and institutions are an emergent behavior of the global political ecosystem.&quot;

Why South Africa's Over the Rainbow - TIME
================================================================================
  &quot;History is full of revolutionaries who failed to make the switch. Most promised people's rule but, once in power, embraced a permanent state of revolution ‚Äî some, like Robert Mugabe and Hugo Ch√°vez, conjuring up fantastical foreign enemies to fight. (To those ranks, now add the leader of the influential ANC Youth League, Julius Malema, who told the East London rally that the young would &quot;never allow them to donate this country to Britain, to the hands of the colonizers.&quot;) To their people, this never-ending war is generally experienced as dictatorship. Too many liberation leaders leave office only when another revolutionary seizes power. ... Mobutu Sese Seko, ruler of Zaire for 32 years, who took the country as personal reward for &quot;liberating&quot; it. ... In India, the Gandhi family has towered over its democracy for 60 years. ... Henning Melber ... fought in Namibia against white rule. Watching his fellow liberators turn on their own people once the war was won...&quot;

The fact that Bjarne Stroustrup et al. uncompromisingly pursued the design goals of efficiency and compatibility resulted in a language, which is very difficult to understand and use (6, 7, 8): Hundreds of special rules for special cases (9, 10, 11, 12, 13), language features that clash when used in particular combinations (14, 15), undefined and implementation-defined behavior everywhere (16, 17).&quot;

> The International Monetary Fund’s top staff misled their own board, made
