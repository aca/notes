NTP
========================================================================
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1970&start=225

NTP will serve the time estimate that the host has. It includes the quality
(dispersion, source info, last correction, etc) so the client can judge which
source to use. If the GPS dies, the quality will decline; eventually to the
point that clients will pick another of its sources. Note that time doesn't
instantly go bad. The GPS merely adjusts ('disciplines' in ntp speak) the
local clock. If the local clock is stable (no wild temperature, power, load
changes) and NTP has run long enough to converge the driftfile, the time will
remain accurate for a 'long' time.

GPS
========================================================================

- GPS delivers 14 numbers: x, y, z, t, vx, vy, vz, and error estimates for
  each of those 7 coordinates. This is a "TPV" (time-position-velocity)
  report. GPS is a TPV oracle.
- gpsd delivers those numbers to user applications with minimum fuss.

Almanac
  The time required for a GPS to get a fix (Time To First Fix (TTFF)) can vary
  from 15s to 30min. The main factors affecting this latency are (a) whether
  it has an almanac available, (b) whether it has satellite ephemerides
  available, and (c) whether it has recent fix available. Of course the
  quality of signal at your location matters as well.

  If a GPS has not been on for several months, then it has no current almanac.
  It must wait to download one before it can generate a fix. This can take
  ~15min.

  While the almanac download takes 15 minutes, you have to be there for the
  start of it, otherwise you have to wait for the next cycle. So if you are
  unlucky and just miss the start of one, it could take just under 29 minutes
  to obtain, and on average closer to 22 min.

  If a GPS has not been on for ~1day then it has a valid almanac but no valid
  satellite ephemerides, and must download at least four before it can
  generate an accurate fix. Each satellite has its own ephemeris that must be
  downloaded if a current copy is not fresh.




gpsd
    tools:
        gpsprof: collects accuracy and latency statistics on GPSes and the GPS+gpsd combination
        ???: tool for decoding RTCM104 reports on satellite health, almanacs,
             and pseudorange information from differential-GPS radios and
             reference stations.
