kreuzberg:
- bells at noon and dusk

two kinds of traffic: cars and bicyles. Cyclists have their own lanes with their
own traffic signals. Pedestrian must be doubling attentive at each crossing.
Traffic signals are fast and frequent instead of lingering and infrequent.

Subway: no turnstiles, self-administered (random checks).

at end of school day, the children at kita (voluntarily) hug each other

Amazing trivia:
  - Any hill (except Viktoria park) in Berlin, is not a natural hill, but
    actually a pile of rubble from WWII

  - Any building that does not have bullet holes is restored or post-war.

On sunday (8 jan 2017) we made a snowman, bodhi named him krustus and didn't
want to leave. "Someone will knock him over." At home bodhi made 15 drawings of
krustus and taped them on the walls of all rooms in the apartment. Next day
I checked on krustus, only the foundation remained. I rebuilt the snowman, and
guarded it until bodhi returned from school. I walked with bodhi to visit
krustus. Bodhi gave the snowman kisses and hugs. "He needs his staff." He
arranged the long stick so that the snowman had a staff. More hugs.
"Uuuuuuuuuuu you're so cute" he said, embracing the snowman. "What language does
he speak", I asked. "He speaks 'snoke'. It sounds like this: pffft pffft
pfthfft."
