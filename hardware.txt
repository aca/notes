DISK MONITORING / FAILURE DETECTION
===================================
    Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population / Pinheiro, Weber, Barroso

        > Some SMART parameters (scan errors, reallocation counts, offline
          reallocation counts, and probational counts) have a large impact on
          failure probability.
        > 56% of failed drives had no count in any of the four strong SMART
          signals ... models based only on those signals can never predict more
          than half of the failed drives
        - 2-6% failure rate year in first year
        - key finding: no consistent pattern of higher failure rates for higher
          temperature or higher utilization
