system design:
  0. Listen and comprehend the question.
  1. gather requirements:
    - API, SLA, CAP, security (CORS,SSL), features, scale, userbase, state
    - AAA: auth, auditing, accounting/billing
    - quantify!
  2. draw LOGICAL diagram showing dataflow & state
    - draw PHYSICAL diagram? (LB, servers, WAF, CDN, â€¦)
  3. end-to-end explain (component details)
    - scaling
    - API
    - db table
    - estimates/calculations
    - technologies

3 words about me:
  leverage
  visibility (fail early)
  unblock (adaptive)

startup life:
  1. fleetscanner: RO filesystem hack
  2. pathtopark: circular route
  3. in-car dashboard: ship now, update OTA
  4. data lake: overlay filesystem
  5. DS pipeline: Luigi + parallel
  6. segment ids: Open Location Code (OLC) https://plus.codes
