    The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized
    as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being
    extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is
    the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.

    The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous
    to a Gambler's Ruin problem.
